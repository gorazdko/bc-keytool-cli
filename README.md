## Introduction

`keytool` is a command-line tool that implements a data flow graph for deriving cryptocurrency keys and addresses. Any of the nodes in the graph can be assigned and any set of nodes can be derived as long as their dependencies are met.

Here are a few examples of use:

### Derive a BIP-32 master HD key from a cryptographic seed

```
$ keytool --seed 8935a8068526d84da555cdb741a3b8a8 master-key
xprv9s21ZrQH143K3rJgfaUmUCueBxbDT1bbksxayh7ik1nZN41zAy2kQNop8REXEAAwqwes1E8rxk1313tyzsNmMq69h4vDyyrXkmjDZ2Nf3pN
```

Derive an arbitrary BIP32 private and public keys from master HD key.

```
$ keytool \
    --master-key xprv9s21ZrQH143K4FAunaSG9eYwrAaaChpSYwYF22eJiZJrz5zSBKTg7NJcFqWR2UZc7EhneSMJhHLmPsKx96UDgv9CdoLc6JfQo3AncKhYNSc \
    --address-derivation-path m/99h/1h/2h/3 \
    address-key \
    address-pub-key

```

Derive 10 successive bitcoin addreses from a seed.

```
for (( i=0; i <= 9; ++i ))
do
    keytool \
    	--seed 1eb5338edac6fae54cbb172091ae6c1a \

## Full Documentation

See [`MANUAL.md`](MANUAL.md) for details, more examples, and version history.

## Dependencies

* [`libwally-core`](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-libwally-core)
* [`GNU argp`](https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/Argp.html)

## Installation

These dependencies are automatically installed as submodules when you run the build script. This is the recommended way to install.

### MacOS

```bash
$ brew install autoconf automake libtool shunit2
```

```bash
$ ./build.sh
$ sudo make install
```

### Build on Linux

Make sure you have `llvm`/`clang`, `libc++` and `libc++abi` installed, all with
a minimum recommended version 10.

#### Build on Ubuntu and Debian

```bash
$ sudo apt install build-essential
$ sudo apt install shunit2

$ wget https://apt.llvm.org/llvm.sh
$ chmod +x llvm.sh
$ sudo ./llvm.sh 10  # version 10

$ sudo apt-get install libc++-10-dev libc++abi-10-dev
```

```bash
$ export CC="clang-10" && export CXX="clang++-10" && ./build.sh
$ sudo make install
```

## Alternative Installation

This sequence does *not* install the dependencies from submodules; instead they must be installed in the usual places on the build system, otherwise the `./configure` step below will fail.

```bash
$ ./configure
$ make
$ sudo make install
```
*Note:* On Linux the first step is `./configure CC=clang-10 CXX=clang++-10`

## Incremental Builds

If you wish to make changes to the source code and rebuild:

```bash
# Make source changes
$ source set_build_paths.sh # sets shell variables used by make
$ make clean # If you want a clean build
$ make
```

## Notes for Maintainers

Before accepting a PR that can affect build or unit tests, make sure the following sequence of commands succeeds:

```bash
$ ./build.sh
$ make check
$ make distclean
```

## Responsible Disclosure

We want to keep all our software safe for everyone. If you have discovered a security vulnerability, we appreciate your help in disclosing it to us in a responsible manner. We are unfortunately not able to offer bug bounties at this time.

We do ask that you offer us good faith and use best efforts not to leak information or harm any user, their data, or our developer community. Please give us a reasonable amount of time to fix the issue before you publish it. Do not defraud our users or us in the process of discovery. We promise not to bring legal action against researchers who point out a problem provided they do their best to follow the these guidelines.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report suspected security vulnerabilities in private via email to ChristopherA@BlockchainCommons.com (do not use this email for support). Please do NOT create publicly viewable issues for suspected security vulnerabilities.

The following keys may be used to communicate sensitive information to developers:

| Name              | Fingerprint                                        |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Christopher Allen | FDFE 14A5 4ECB 30FC 5D22  74EF F8D3 6C91 3574 05ED |

You can import a key by running the following command with that individualâ€™s fingerprint: `gpg --recv-keys "<fingerprint>"` Ensure that you put quotes around fingerprints that contain spaces.
